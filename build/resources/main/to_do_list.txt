—Add castling (MoveLogic)

—Add stalemate logic,
    Potentially make a new class called CheckLogic to include both this, and checks

—Fix bug when highlighting king
    Make sure if King has red check highlight, it stays after green goes away
    This might be a pain...

—Make pixel pawns smaller and more rounded

—Go through every class and resolve warnings

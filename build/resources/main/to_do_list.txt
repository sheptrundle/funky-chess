—Add castling (MoveLogic)

—Add stalemate logic,
    Potentially make a new class called CheckLogic to include both this, and checks

—Make pixel pawns smaller and more rounded

—Fix bug where Pawn cant capture diagonally to save king from check
        Maybe don't need any Pawn-flip logic if we use a double-sided board?
        Pawn can also move forward when pinned
        Hypothetically both of these bugs can be solved by using a two-sided board. Will require a LOT of refactoring

—Go through every class and resolve warnings
